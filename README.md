# Backround

This is a volunteer web project I am doing for my father's Volkswagen auto repair shop in Colma, CA. It is designed to be a landing page with a description, hours, and a contact form. It is not finished at this time, but it is the project I am currently working on.

# Techstack

This project is being built using tailwind.css, JavaScript, Next.js and React. It is my first time working with Next.js and there are still more features I am working on adding. 

# Webpage

Although unfinished, the website is deployed at https://tassiinc.vercel.app/ and will be moved to a different domain when completed
